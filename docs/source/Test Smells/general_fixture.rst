Test Without Description
========================
This type of test smell occurs when the test setup defines multiple data or objects, but only a subset is used. The example demonstrates that the test has a beforeEach block, which by definition is executed before each test, ensuring that each instance is initialized with defined values. However, no test case uses the guest variable.
Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   let user;
   let admin;
   let guest;

   beforeEach(() => {
    user = new User("Alice", 30);
    admin = new Admin("Bob", 20);
    guest = new Guest("Charlie", 25);
   });

   test("user should have a name", () => {
   expect(user.name).toBe("Alice");
   });

   test("admin should have an age", () => {
   expect(admin.age).toBe(40);
   });

Refactor:

.. code-block:: javascript

   let user;
   let admin;

   beforeEach(() => {
   user = new User("Alice", 30);
   admin = new Admin("Bob", 40);
   });

   test("user should have a name", () => {
   expect(user.name).toBe("Alice");
   });

   test("admin should have an age", () => {
   expect(admin.age).toBe(40);
   });


.. note::
   The test case defines and initializes guest, but it is not used in any test. This creates unnecessary setup, making the code harder to understand. It is recommended to keep only the variables that are necessary for the tests.
