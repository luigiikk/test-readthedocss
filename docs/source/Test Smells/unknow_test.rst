Unknown Test
================
This type of test smell occurs when the test case does not contain a single assertion statement. Tests without assertions provide no verification of behavior, making them ineffective and misleading in terms of test coverage.

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  test('does not contain any assertions', () => {
    const value = 5; // Does something, but no assertion is made
    // No expectation or assertion is made here
  });

Refactor:

.. note::
  Every test should include at least one assertion to verify expected behavior. Tests without assertions should be removed or completed to ensure meaningful validation.
