Redundant Assertions
======================
This type of test smell occurs when the test case contains assertions that do not add value, such as asserting known truths or duplicating existing validations. These tests contribute no meaningful feedback and clutter the test suite.

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

Refactor:

.. code-block:: javascript


.. note::
  Avoid including assertions that simply confirm language or framework behavior. Focus on verifying meaningful business logic or specific functionality relevant to the application.
