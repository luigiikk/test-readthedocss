Non-Functional Statement
========================
This type of test smell occurs when there are statements in the test code that produce no functional effect. It means the presence of useless or redundant code segments that remain in the test as empty functions or blocks, and any lines of code that do not alter or contribute to the execution of the test.

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  it('calls addEventListener on the target', function () {
  listen(target, 'foo', function () {});
  expect(add.callCount).to.be(1);
  });



.. note::
  The test contains a non-functional statement in the form of an empty callback function. It’s recommended to remove or replace these empty code segments if they do not contribute to the test’s purpose.
