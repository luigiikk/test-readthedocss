Anonymous Test
========================
This type of smell is defined when a name is not descriptive enough to be fully understood in its context. In the test example, the expression should work can be interpreted in different ways within the test block, making the test block unclear and potentially hindering future maintenance. Therefore, descriptive phrases are crucial for test readability.
Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   it("should work", () => {
   const result = getAge();
   expect(result).toBeEqual(10);
   });

Refactor:

.. code-block:: javascript

   it("should be able to get the age", () => {
   const result = getAge();
   expect(result).toBeEqual(10);
   });


.. note::
   The test case description should be clear and concise, providing a brief overview of the test case purpose and expected behavior.
