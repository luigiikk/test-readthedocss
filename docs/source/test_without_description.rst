Test Without Description

This type of test smell occurs when a test block lacks a description. In the test example, the test case has an empty description, which can affect the readability and future maintenance of the mentioned example. Test cases must have clear and coherent descriptions relevant to their defined context, ensuring they fulfill their objectives.

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   it("", () => {
   const result = getPermission();
   expect(result).toBe(true);
   });
