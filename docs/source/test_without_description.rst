Test Without Description
========================
This type of test smell occurs when a test block lacks a description. In the test example, the test case has an empty description, which can affect the readability and future maintenance of the mentioned example. Test cases must have clear and coherent descriptions relevant to their defined context, ensuring they fulfill their objectives.

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   it("", () => {
   const result = getPermission();
   expect(result).toBe(true);
   });

Refactor:

.. code-block:: javascript

   it("should be able to get permission", () => {
  const result = getPermission();
  expect(result).toBe(true);
   });

.. note::
   The test case description should be clear and concise, providing a brief overview of the test case purpose and expected behavior.
